# Deep mutational scanning data

Data from [Bloom lab](https://jbloomlab.org/) pseudovirus deep mutational scanning of RSV F.
Note that these data are currently **in progress** and are not yet final QC-ed values.
Once they are, the data can likely be read directly from the Bloom lab GitHub repo rather than physically stored here.

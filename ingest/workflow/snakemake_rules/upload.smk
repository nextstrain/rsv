"""
This part of the workflow handles uploading files to a specified destination.

Uses predefined wildcard `file_to_upload` determine input and predefined
wildcard `remote_file_name` as the remote file name in the specified destination.

Produces output files as `data/upload/{upload_target_name}/{file_to_upload}-to-{remote_file_name}.done`.

Currently only supports uploads to AWS S3, but additional upload rules can
be easily added as long as they follow the output pattern described above.
